##Death of Dmoz
After announcing the death (officialy) of Dmoz, I created this repositery to share Dmoz Data in CSV format importable directly to Neo4j graph database.

##Data

##Neo4j Import

##Install
- There are no real install, all you need is to copy the csv files and run the Node.Js function (which is optional) to import them.
